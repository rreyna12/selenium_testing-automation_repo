This folder contains any and all unit test files for the python functions related to
the Selenium "test_googleDrive_Upload-and-Cleanup" project.

Since there are a lot of test files involved in this project, naming the folder
"unit tests" vs "tests" to help clarify.  (Ex: "testFiles" folder contains any files
that will be used as part of the test, so for example any .txt, .csv, etc file types
that will be uploaded to Google Drive).

*Since the overall project is testing Selenium, which is an open source automated testing
tool that tests web-based interactions, not every module will need to have a unit test.
